🚌 BUS FILTERING BY BOARDING STOP - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!
===========================================================

FUNCTION CREATED: getBusesByBoardingStop()
=========================================

✅ API ENDPOINT: GET /api/buses/stop/:stopName
✅ UTILITY FUNCTION: getAvailableBusesByStop(stopName)

HOW IT WORKS:
============

1. VALIDATION:
   - Checks if stop name is provided
   - Gets all active buses from database

2. FILTERING LOGIC:
   - Finds buses that have the stop in their route.stops[]
   - Ensures bus continues beyond this stop (stop.order < maxOrder)
   - Only returns buses where passengers can board and reach further destinations

3. RESPONSE DATA:
   - Bus information (ID, number, route name, driver, capacity)
   - Boarding stop details (name, coordinates, order)
   - Stops remaining after boarding
   - Optional: Real-time driver status and passenger count

EXAMPLE USAGE:
=============

// 1. API Call
GET /api/buses/stop/Meerut
GET /api/buses/stop/Meerut?includeDriverStatus=true

// 2. Programmatic Usage
import { getAvailableBusesByStop } from './controllers/bus.controllers.js';
const buses = await getAvailableBusesByStop('Meerut');

WITH DRIVER STATUS:
------------------
GET /api/buses/stop/Meerut?includeDriverStatus=true

Additional fields in response:
- isDriverOnline: boolean
- connectedPassengers: number

FILTERING LOGIC EXPLAINED:
=========================

Example Route: Delhi → Ghaziabad → Meerut → Muzaffarnagar → Haridwar
Stop Orders:   1      → 2         → 3     → 4             → 5

✅ User boards at "Meerut" (order: 3)
✅ Bus continues to Muzaffarnagar (order: 4) and Haridwar (order: 5)
✅ stopsRemaining = 5 - 3 = 2 stops
✅ Bus is AVAILABLE for boarding

❌ If user boards at "Haridwar" (order: 5)
❌ No stops after Haridwar (maxOrder = 5, order = 5)
❌ Bus is NOT AVAILABLE (can't board at final destination)

BUSINESS LOGIC:
==============

✅ Only shows buses where passengers can travel further
✅ Prevents boarding at the last stop (no point in boarding)
✅ Case-insensitive stop name matching
✅ Includes boarding stop coordinates for map display
✅ Shows remaining journey information

INTEGRATION WITH REAL-TIME SYSTEM:
==================================

✅ Can include real-time driver status
✅ Shows current passenger count
✅ Compatible with socket-based location tracking
✅ Perfect for passenger mobile apps

USE CASES:
=========

🎯 Passenger app: "Show me all buses passing through my stop"
🎯 Route planning: "Which buses can I take from Meerut?"
🎯 Real-time tracking: "Are drivers online for my route?"
🎯 Capacity planning: "How crowded are buses from this stop?"
